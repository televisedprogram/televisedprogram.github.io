                    I want to write for you. That's right, you. I want to write about anything. Say it with me, anything. Your small business, your big business, your good band, and your bad band. I'll write about your old invention you're reinventing, that screenplay you've been playing around with. I want to write for your non-profit and your for-profit, your newsletter, your satire site, and your web-series.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    I'll write anywhere. I'll write in your office, your garage, or on my porch. I'll write in the passenger seat of your sedan or on the eighth floor of your high-rise. I'll write for you.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Besides writing, I like a lot of things like celadon, Jawbreaker, stories by Lydia Davis, the desert, and lists. And I dislike some things too, including, but not limited to, the royal "we," eggs, and when people say "I'm not a pessimist, I'm just a realist." But I only love three things: my mother, waking up before sunrise, and writing for you.
