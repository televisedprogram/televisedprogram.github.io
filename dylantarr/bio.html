                    Dylan Tarr is a Grand Rapids-based writer, fiction junkie, and rock and roll purist. He has written for Lansing’s alternative newspaper City Pulse, the Michigan State student run publication ing Magazine, and satire website The Hard Times.

                    While at Michigan State University, he earned a B.A. in English literature and an additional degree in writing and editing for publication. While living in Lansing’s east-side, he co-founded and played bass/guitar in the post-hardcore band, Convenient Trash. After graduating from MSU, he moved to Grand Rapids to pursue a career as a freelance writer.

                    Besides writing, he likes Jawbreaker, Nine Stories, the desert, and as an avid runner, enjoys confidently describing a five-mile jog as “relaxing.” He dislikes some things too. Including, but not limited to, the royal "we," and when people say, "I'm not a pessimist, I'm just a realist."
